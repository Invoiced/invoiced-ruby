## Installing

The Invoiced gem can be installed liked this:

```
gem install invoiced
```

It can be added to your Gemfile:

```
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'invoiced'
```

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.0+
- rest_client gem

## Usage

First, you must instantiate a new client

```ruby
require 'invoiced'

invoiced = Invoiced::Client.new("{API_KEY}")
```

Then, API calls can be made like this:
```ruby
# retrieve invoice
invoice = invoiced.Invoice.retrieve("{INVOICE_ID}")

# mark as paid
transaction = invoiced.Transaction.create(
    :invoice => invoice.id,
    :amount => invoice.balance,
    :method => "check")
```

If you want to use the sandbox API instead then you must set the second argument on the client to `true` like this:

```ruby
require 'invoiced'

invoiced = Invoiced::Client.new("{API_KEY}", true)
```

## Developing

The gem can be built with:

```
gem build invoiced.gemspec
```

The test suite can be ran with `rake test`
